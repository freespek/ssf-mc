\section{Python to \tlap{} translation rules}

On the Python side, we have the $\texttt{typing}$ package and types defined in $\texttt{pyrsistent}$. 

We assume the existence of a type-translation from those types to Apalache's type system.

We maintain the following convention: if $\tau$ is the Python type, we label the corresponding Apalache type as $\htau$.

\section{Introduction}

\colorbox{yellow}{RS, TH: A short intro to the protocol}

\paragraph{}\colorbox{yellow}{TODO:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item what we want to model-check
  \item why \tlap{}
  \item introduce Apalache
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Complexity of (model-checking) the protocol.} The 3SF protocol is
intricate, with a high degree of combinatorial complexity, making it challenging
to reason about. We have observed multiple layers of complexity in the protocol:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The Python specification considers all possible graphs over all proposed
    blocks. From graph theory~\cite{cayley1878theorem}, we know that the number
    of labelled rooted forests on $n$ vertices is ${(n+1)}^{n-1}$. (Observe that
    this number grows faster than the factorial~$n!$.) This is the number of
    possible block graphs that the model checker has to consider for $n$ blocks.
  \item The protocol introduces a directed graph of checkpoints (pairs $(b,n)$
    of a block $b$ and an integer $n$) \emph{on top} of the block graph.
    Validator-signed votes form a third labeled directed graph over pairs of
    checkpoints. In addition, all of these edges have to satisfy arithmetic
    constraints.
  \item Justified and finalized checkpoints introduce an inductive structure
    that the model checker has to reason about. Essentially, the solvers have to
    reason about chains of checkpoints on top of chains of blocks.
  \item Finally, the protocol introduces cardinalities, both for determining a
    quorum of validators and as a threshold for \textit{AccountableSafety}.
    Cardinalities are known to be a source of inefficiency in automated
    reasoning.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key Outcomes}

\subsection{Overview of the report}

Figure~\ref{fig:artifacts} depicts the relations between the specifications
that we have produced in the project:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We have started with the executable specification in Python.

    \item \textbf{Spec 1}: This is the specification
        \texttt{spec1-2/ffg\_recursive.tla}. It is the result of a manual
        mechanical translation of the original executable specification in
        Python, which can be found in \texttt{ffg.py}. This specification is
        using mutually recursive operators, which are not supported by
        Apalache. As a result, we are not checking this specification. This
        specification is the result of our work in Milestone 1.

    \item \textbf{Spec 2}: This is the specification \texttt{spec1-2/ffg.tla}. It
        is a manual adaptation of Spec 1. The main difference between Spec 2
        and Spec 1 is that Spec 2 uses ``folds'' (also known as ``reduce'')
        instead of recursion.

      \item \colorbox{yellow}{TBD}

\end{enumerate}

Figure~\ref{fig:block-graphs} shows small graphs, most of which form one or
more chains. In the simple cases~\ref{fig:three}--\ref{fig:single}, we have one
or two chains that form a tree. In a more general case like in
Figure~\ref{fig:forest}, a graph is a forest. The graphs in
Figures~\ref{fig:tricky1}--\ref{fig:tricky2} do not represent chains.  The
graph~\texttt{I1} is a direct-acyclic graph but not a forest. The
graph~\texttt{I2} has a loop.

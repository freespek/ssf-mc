\section{Introduction}

At the time of writing this report, Ethereum is using
Gasper~\cite{buterin2020combining} as the underlying consensus protocol.
In Gasper, time is divided into slots, which represent intervals during which a new block is proposed to extend the blockchain and undergoes voting. 
Finalizing a block--ensuring that it is permanently added to the blockchain and cannot be reversed--typically requires 64 to 95 slots.
This delay in finality makes the network more vulnerable to potential
block reorganizations when the network conditions change, 
e.g., during periods of asynchronous network conditions.
In particular, this finalization delay heightens the network’s exposure to
Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) exploits, 
which could undermine the network’s integrity.
Additionally, the extended finalization period forces users to weigh the
trade-off between economic security and transaction speed.

To address these issues and speed up finality, D’Amato et al.~\cite{d20243} have recently introduced the \emph{3-slot-finality} (3SF) protocols 
for Ethereum that achieve finality within three slots after a proposal, hence realizing 3-slot finality.
This feature is particularly beneficial in practical scenarios where periods of synchrony and robust honest participation often 
last much longer than the time needed for finalization in the 3SF protocol.
Finally, the 3SF protocol enhances the practicality of large-scale blockchain networks by enabling the dynamically-available component, 
which handles honest participants who may go offline and come back online~\cite{pass2017sleepy}, 
to recover from extended asynchrony, provided at least two-thirds of validators remain honest and online for sufficient time. 

To that end, the 3SF protocols combine a partially synchronous finality gadget with two dynamically available consensus protocols – 
synchronous protocols that ensure safety and liveness even with fluctuating validator participation levels. 
This design is based on the \emph{ebb-and-flow} approach introduced in~\cite{neu2021ebb}. 
An ebb-and-flow protocol comprises two sub-protocols, each with its own confirmation rule, and each outputting a chain, with one serving 
as a prefix of the other. 
The first confirmation rule defines what is known as the \emph{available chain}, which provides liveness under dynamic participation
(and synchrony). 
The second confirmation rule defines the \emph{finalized chain}, and provides safety even under network partitions, but loses liveness 
either under asynchrony or in case of fluctuation in the participation level.

In this project, we targeted the 3SF specification in Python \footnote{Link to the Python specification:
\href{https://github.com/saltiniroberto/ssf/blob/ad3ba2c21bc1cd554a870a6e0e4d87040558e129/high_level/common/ffg.py}{https://github.com/saltiniroberto/ssf/.../ffg.py}} as the case study focusing only on the finality gadget protocol, which is mostly specified in the file \texttt{ffg.py}.
Our main goal was to demonstrate 
\emph{Accountable Safety} of this protocol by the means of model checking. 
Accountable Safety is the property which ensures that if two conflicting chain (i.e. chains where neither is a prefix of the other) are finalized then, by having access to all messages sent, it is possible to identify at least 1/3 responsible participants. 

% \paragraph{}\colorbox{yellow}{TODO:}

% We have started this project with the Python specification of accountable
% safety in the 3SF Protocol\footnote{URL to the Python specification:
% \url{https://github.com/freespek/ssf-mc/3sf.txt}}. The main goal of the project
% was to demonstrate accountable safety of this protocol by the means of model
% checking.

We have chosen the specification language~\tlap{} and the model checker
Apalache for the following reasons.\ \tlap{} remains a goto language for
specifying consensus algorithms. Among the rich spectrum of
specifications~\cite{tla-examples}, the most notable for our project are the
specifications of Paxos~\cite{lamport2001paxos}, Raft~\cite{Ongaro14}, and
Tendermint~\cite{abs-1807-04938,TendermintSpec2020}. Since consensus algorithms
are quite challenging for classical model checkers like TLC, we choose
Apalache~\cite{Apalache2024,KT19,KonnovKM22}. This model checker utilizes the
SMT solver~Z3~\cite{MouraB08} in the background. Apalache was used for model
checking of agreement and accountable safety of
Tendermint~\cite{TendermintSpec2020}. As added benefit, four of the project
participants developed Apalache in the past and know its strenghts and
weaknesses.

\paragraph{Complexity of (model-checking) the protocol.} The 3SF protocol is
intricate, with a high degree of combinatorial complexity, making it challenging
to reason about. We have observed multiple layers of complexity in the protocol:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The Python specification considers all possible graphs over all proposed
    blocks. From graph theory~\cite{cayley1878theorem}, we know that the number
    of labelled rooted forests on $n$ vertices is ${(n+1)}^{n-1}$. (Observe that
    this number grows faster than the factorial~$n!$.) This is the number of
    possible block graphs that the model checker has to consider for $n$ blocks.
  \item The protocol introduces a directed graph of checkpoints (pairs $(b,n)$
    of a block $b$ and an integer $n$) \emph{on top} of the block graph.
    Validator-signed votes form a third labeled directed graph over pairs of
    checkpoints. In addition, all of these edges have to satisfy arithmetic
    constraints.
  \item Justified and finalized checkpoints introduce an inductive structure
    that the model checker has to reason about. Essentially, the solvers have to
    reason about chains of checkpoints on top of chains of blocks.
  \item Finally, the protocol introduces set cardinalities, both for determining a
    quorum of validators and as a threshold for \textit{AccountableSafety}.
    Cardinalities are known to be a source of inefficiency in automated
    reasoning.
\end{itemize}

  \caption{The relation between the specification artifacts}\label{fig:artifacts}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:artifacts} depicts the relations between the specifications
that we have produced in the project:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We have started with the executable specification in Python.

    \item \SpecOne{}: This is the specification
        \texttt{spec1-2/ffg\_recursive.tla}. It is the result of a manual
        mechanical translation of the original executable specification in
        Python, which can be found in \texttt{ffg.py}. This specification is
        using mutually recursive operators, which are not supported by
        Apalache. As a result, we are not checking this specification. This
        specification is the result of our work in Milestones~1 and~3.
        It is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:spec1}.

    \item \SpecTwo{}: This is the specification \texttt{spec1-2/ffg.tla}. It is
        a manual adaptation of~\SpecOne{}. The main difference
        between~\SpecTwo{} and~\SpecOne{} is that~\SpecTwo{} uses ``folds''
        (also known as ``reduce'') instead of recursion. This specification is
        the result of our work in Milestones~1 and~2. It is discussed in
        Section~\ref{sec:spec2}.

    \item \SpecThree{}: This is the further abstraction of~\SpecTwo{} that uses
        the concept of a state machine, instead of a purely sequential
        specification (such as the Python code). This specification is the
        result of our work in Milestone~2. It is discussed in
        Section~\ref{sec:spec3}.

    \item \SpecFour{}: This is an extension of~\SpecThree{} that contains
        an inductive invariant in~\texttt{spec4/ffg\_inductive.tla}.
        This specification is the result of our work in Milestone~4.
        It is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:spec4}.

    \item \SpecFourB{} contains further abstractions and decomposition of
        configurations. This is the first~\tlap{} specification that allowed us
        to show accountable safety for models of very small size. This
        specification is the result of our work in Milestone~4.
        It is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:spec4b}.

    \item \SpecThreeB{} contains a specification in SMT using the theory of
        finite sets and cardinalities. In combination with the solver
        CVC5~\cite{BarbosaBBKLMMMN22}, this specification allows us to push
        verification of accountable safety even further. This specification is
        the result of our work in Milestone~4. It is discussed in
        Section~\ref{sec:smt}.

    \item \SpecThreeC{} contains a specification in
        Alloy~\cite{jackson2012software,alloytools}. With this specification,
        we manage to check all small configurations that cover the base case
        and one inductive step of the definitions. This specification is the
        result of our work in Milestone~4. It is discussed in
        Section~\ref{sec:alloy}.

    \item Section~\ref{section3} contains the translation rules and proofs
        that were conducted in Milestone~3.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Introduction}

TODO\footnote{RS, TH: A short intro to the protocol?}

Figure~\ref{fig:artifacts} depicts the relations between the specifications
that we have produced in the project:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We have started with the executable specification in Python.

    \item \textbf{Spec 1}: This is the specification
        \texttt{spec1-2/ffg\_recursive.tla}. It is the result of a manual
        mechanical translation of the original executable specification in
        Python, which can be found in \texttt{ffg.py}. This specification is
        using mutually recursive operators, which are not supported by
        Apalache. As a result, we are not checking this specification. This
        specification is the result of our work in Milestone 1.

    \item \textbf{Spec 2}: This is the specification \texttt{spec1-2/ffg.tla}. It
        is a manual adaptation of Spec 1. The main difference between Spec 2
        and Spec 1 is that Spec 2 uses ``folds'' (also known as ``reduce'')
        instead of recursion.

    \item TBD

\end{enumerate}

Figure~\ref{fig:block-graphs} shows small graphs, most of which form one or
more chains. In the simple cases~\ref{fig:three}--\ref{fig:single}, we have one
or two chains that form a tree. In a more general case like in
Figure~\ref{fig:forest}, a graph is a forest. The graphs in
Figures~\ref{fig:tricky1}--\ref{fig:tricky2} do not represent chains.  The
graph~\texttt{I1} is a direct-acyclic graph but not a forest. The
graph~\texttt{I2} has a loop.

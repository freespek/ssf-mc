\begin{abstract}

We explore automated model-checking of the Ethereum specification, specifically
the accountable safety of the 3SF protocol. We use~\tlap{} as our primary
specification language and the Apalache model checker with the Z3 SMT solver as
a backend. As a first step, we manually translate the Python specification
into~\tlap{}. This reveals the high combinatorial complexity related to the
definitions of accountable safety in the 3SF protocol.

To address these challenges, we apply multiple layers of manual abstractions,
such as (1) using folds instead of recursion, (2) integers in place of abstract
graphs, and (3) decomposing chain configurations. We also develop
specifications in SMT (CVC5) and Alloy. Despite the challenges, our results show that
exhaustive verification of accountable safety is feasible for small
instances with up to 7 checkpoints and 24 validator votes, and we found no
falsification of accountable safety in slightly larger configurations. Our
study underscores the value of manual abstraction and expertise in enhancing
model-checking efficiency and highlights \tlap{}'s flexibility in handling
abstractions.

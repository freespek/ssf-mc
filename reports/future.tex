  \item \emph{Generating inputs to the Python specification.} As we have noted,
    the power of our~\tlap{} specifications is the ability to generate examples
    with Apalache. This would help the authors of the Python specification to
    produce tests for their specifications.

  \item \emph{Specifications of a refined protocol.} The current version of the
    Python specification is very abstract. On one hand, it is usually
    beneficial to specify a high-level abstraction. On the other hand, as we
    found, the current level of abstraction is quite close to the general
    inductive definitions of justified and finalized checkpoints. We expect a
    refined protocol specification to be more amenable to model checking.

  \item \emph{Transferring the Alloy encoding to Apalache.} As we have found in
    this project, Alloy offers richer options for fine tuning in terms of the
    search scope. In combination with steady advances in SAT solving, adapting
    the Alloy encoding to Apalache would improve model checking performance,
    ultimately leading to a faster feedback loop and faster specification
    development.

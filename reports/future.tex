  \item \emph{Generating inputs to the Python specification.} As we have noted,
    the power of our~\tlap{} specifications is the ability to generate examples
    with Apalache. This could help the authors of the Python specification to
    produce tests for their specifications.

  \item \emph{Specifications of a refined protocol.} The current version of
    the Python specification is very abstract. On one hand, it is usually
    beneficial to specify a high-level abstraction. On the other hand, as we
    found, this level of abstraction is quite close to the general inductive
    definitions of justified and finalized checkpoints. We should have better
    chances at model checking more refined protocol specifications.

  \item \emph{Transferring the Alloy encoding to Apalache.} As we have found in
    this project, Alloy offers richer options for fine tuning in terms of
    search scope. Moreover, given steady advances in SAT solving, this gives us
    hope for achieving a faster feedback loop with model checking of
    distributed protocols such as the 3SF protocol.

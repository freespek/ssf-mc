# Alloy specification of 3SF tuned towards AccountableSafety

This directory contains an [Alloy][] specification of the 3SF protocol, which
abstracts the features that are not important for checking `AccountableSafety`.

We have written this specification in an attempt to check `AccountableSafety`
for small but not nonsensical configurations.
